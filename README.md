## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://imgur.com/WeBY8lz)

Levitate is a meditation page with soothing audio embeded on every mode.
Sit and Relax your Body & Soul with Buddha

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

 So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
